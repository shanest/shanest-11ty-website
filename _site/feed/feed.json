			"title": "_The Hidden Life of Trees_ by Peter Wohlleben",
			"content_html": "<p><em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, Peter Wohlleben (audio).  A wonderful book that explains the ways in which trees communicate, live and die, and even interact socially.  (Amongst many other amazing behaviors, e.g. wound-tending.)  Written by a forest manager, and covering some of the relevant academic literature (e.g. around the role of mycelium networks in aiding communication in root systems), this book felt like a very refreshing &quot;natural history&quot; kind of book: it's largely a narration of what you will see if you look closer and understand trees---and forests, in particular, as the difference between re-planted groves of trees and the richness of natural forests is a recurring theme---on their own terms and, in particular, at their own time-scale.  I certainly won't look at trees the same way after this.  Grade: A</p>\n",

			"title": "_Life As We Know It (Can Be)_ by Bill Weir",
			"content_html": "<p><em>Life as We Know It (Can Be)</em>, Bill Weir (audio). This book was an odd mix of (i) interesting anecdotes that are intended to inspire climate optimism and/or a call to action and (ii) personal memoir.  This second component was especially prominent in one of the two recurring leitmotifs throughout the book: writing letters to his young son about what his climate future might look like.  (The other recurring motif was Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Both felt a bit forced.). While I did learn some things (e.g. about alternative food sources), the book honestly felt too personal to me, especially in the last couple of chapters when it became something of an apology for being a bit absent from his family while traveling the world for his TV shows.  Grade: B</p>\n",
