    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a lot of multipitch climbing this year in preparation for and culminating in a climb of the West Ridge of Prusik Peak,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I plan to write about this trip and some of the prep ones soon.&lt;/span&gt; B and I spent most of July on our bikes, riding STP (Seattle to Portland) in one day followed up by RAMROD (Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day).&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Do organized bike rides deserve trip reports?!&lt;/span&gt;  With summer starting to feel like its beginning to wane, and with lots of travel coming up in September, but also with our bodies being pretty fried, we wanted to take another trip into the alpine.  The goal: at most type 1.5 fun, beautiful views, fun climbing, and hopefully a “cute lil overnighter” as well.  Enter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110928196/ingalls-peak&quot;&gt;Ingalls&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1-seattle-to-camp&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Day 1: Seattle to camp &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://shane.st/trip-reports/ingalls/#day-1-seattle-to-camp&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of having a more casual outing, we left Seattle around 2 or 2:30pm on Saturday.  With one pit stop at the Safeway in Cle Elum, we reached the Esmeralda trailhead just after 5pm and started walking around 5:30.  The start of the trail—including the turn on to Ingalls Way trail after about a quarter mile—was great: shady, smooth, with a very gradual rise to gain elevation.  A group of trail runners flying down made it clear to us how imminently runnable this trail is.  Before too long, we were starting to poke above the trees and got our first view of Tahoma (Rainier).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Our first view of Tahoma/Rainier in the distance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail gradually became more and more exposed and accordingly dusty.  A definite high-desert feel.  After passing a fork for John’s Pass, the trail makes almost a straight exposed line for Ingall’s pass.  Though the terrain becomes slightly rockier, the trail maintains the gradual rise throughout, so you can really make great time gaining the vert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the pass, you can chooose to stay high or dip low into a basin.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Trail 1390.1 up high, 1390.2 down low.&lt;/span&gt; We didn’t have a ton of beta on campsites, except an expectation that there are more on the low loop, but should be some up high too.  Since the former requires losing and then re-gaining some vert, we stayed up high and began keeping our eyes open for good sites.  It was also at this point that we got our first look at our objective for tomorrow: Ingalls’ south ridge/face was catching the last rays of sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Tomorrow&#39;s route (South Ridge of Ingalls) glowing in the day&#39;s last sun. Should this be renamed the wall of late evening light?
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it didn’t seem like it at first, after another quarter mile or so, you pass through a grove and come to an area with lots of very nice sites, near the one real stream for water and even a pit toilet.  We poked around for a site that optimized tranquility, views, and proximity to water, and settled on a beauty.  We finished setting up the tent just in time to watch the sun set over the majestic Mt Stuart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Our blue Black Diamond tent set up for the night, with Mt Stuart in the background.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tranquility, the one downside was a group of youths playing music from a boombox a few sites over.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Not to mention leaving a full-size kitchen trash bag hanging from a tree at their site.&lt;/span&gt;  I’m sure I don’t need to get on a soap box here about leaving that at home or at least playing music softly enough so that it doesn’t interfere with other peoples’ experiences.  Luckily, their music choice was surprisingly enjoyable—Fleetwood Mac, Frank Sinatra, Alanis Morissette, Pink Floyd—and they did shut things down not too long after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both recently upgraded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/45LfArl&quot;&gt;Nemo Tensor&lt;/a&gt; pads, which are amazingly comfortable.  Unfortunately, my ultralight “2-person” tent cannot really fit two wide pads.  Some creative geometry got them sandwiched against each other and the walls of the tent, and we were able to happily pass out after some delicious grocery store sandwiches and a little old fashioned in a plastic bottle.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;My friends know a small cocktail is one of my trail treats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2-the-climb-and-exit&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Day 2: the climb and exit &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://shane.st/trip-reports/ingalls/#day-2-the-climb-and-exit&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our goal for a type-1.5 alpine climb weekend was avoiding a super early alpine start.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Ingalls can certainly be done in a day, but with a 2.5 hour drive from Seattle, it turns into a quite long one.&lt;/span&gt;  To that end, we set our alarms for 6:45am, and then slept in a little longer, savoring the comfort of those new Nemo pads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 7:15am, we heard a relatively large group of Mounties&lt;label for=&quot;sn-6&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-6&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;A.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mountaineers.org/&quot;&gt;Mountaineers&lt;/a&gt;. They tend to travel in relatively large groups.&lt;/span&gt; on the trail, stopping for a bathroom and water-filling break.  This was one other reason for doing this trip as an overnighter: we knew the Mountaineers were having a trip to Ingalls on Sunday 08/10 (and also 08/09), but thought that camping might get us to the climb before they did.  Oh well; you can’t have it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a nice coffee and breakfast with a view, we finally left camp at the luxurious hour of 9am.  The half mile or so to Ingalls Lake should have been smooth sailing, and mostly was.  One problem: the heat.  Even at this hour, it was zapping me.  I’m not sure what exactly it was, but I got hit with some extreme nauseau and had to take a short break.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-7&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-7&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Couldn’t have been last night’s little cocktail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, life was restored, and we continued on the approach from the lake, where it takes on a decidedly different character.  In typical Cascade fashion, the last bit of the approach steepens considerably.  Luckily, it started walking up slabs, which made for great time.  We followed a lush gully a bit too high, and had to do some traverse-y shenanigans to get farther right and into a proper scree gully for the final bit of the approach.  Because of the heat, the going was a little slower than normal, but it wasn’t too long before we were at the base of the climb.  One party had just started&lt;label for=&quot;sn-8&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-8&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Turns out, this was the last of the Mounties.&lt;/span&gt; and another was gearing up to go.  A line, but not too bad of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;B in the scree gully, with Ingalls Lake and Mt Stuart in the background.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were almost done getting geared up for the route when the final scare of the day hit: we thought B had left her belay device at home.  Turns out, it was just really far back on her harness.  My apparently-very-angry face wiped clean, it was time to start the climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two pitches were very fast.  Aside from 5-10 feet near the top of pitch 1, it felt entirely like a scramble.  I eventually put one cam and clipped in to the anchor on pitch 1 and linked it with “pitch” 2.  This was 15 meters of pure scrambling, where I didn’t place any additional protection at all.  We joined our friends—named S and P—from the base at the very large ledge&lt;label for=&quot;sn-9&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-9&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Sometimes called “the dance floor”.&lt;/span&gt; while waiting for the earlier party to clear out of the pitch 3 anchors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch 3 looked like a great pitch of actual rock climbing.  The first half has two cracks: a 5.4 to the left and a 5.6 up the middle.  The former gives the route its grade, but the latter was both more aesthetic and more natural a line, so I opted for that one.  Although my nascent crack climbing skills leave something to be desired, this pitch was still low-angle enough that it never felt insecure.  Progress was fast, and whenver I wanted to place a piece, I could find a good foot jam in the crack to hang out and make sure it was alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Me, putting in another piece of protection from a very good stance halfway up pitch 3.  This is at the end of the 5.6 crack crux of the route, which was quite fun and protected well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway up, the pitch traverses horizontally along an interesting juggy crack, then up a few feet into 10-20 feet of easy terrain before one more crack to an anchor.  This one is on the characteristically-slippery rock (called “serpentine” for reasons I need to look up).  So even though it was not physically difficult, I took even extra care to place my feet securely on the relatively frictionless rock.  Before too long, I was clipping into a luxurious bolted anchor after a very fun pitch.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-10&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-10&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;And one where I was happy with my placements and extensions, having zero rope drag even at the top.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth and final pitch was fairly short and unremarkable as well.  Two pieces in total; after placing the second, I waited for awhile as a party worked to begin the rappel from the anchor, which admittedly involved an awkward lower-off from the top.  Once they were on their way, a little climb up a corner on very slick rock lead to a juggy lip and a comfortable top out at another bolted anchor.  I rose above to find our friends S and P fully napping on the summit waiting for their turn to rap down after the Mounties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with them and deciding to join ropes to make the rappel down the route faster, B and I put our approach shoes back on and walked over a few hundred feet to tag the actual summit.  The views here were amazing: in addition to Stuart,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-11&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-11&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Washington’s second largest non-volcanic mountain.&lt;/span&gt; we enjoyed views of Dakobed / Glacier Peak, Kulshan / Mt Baker, Tahoma / Rainier, Pahto / Adams, and even Wy’east / Hood in the distance.  Not to mention the rest of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in the Snoqualmie pass region as well.  Hard to beat that kind of summit view!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Dakobed / Glacier Peak and Kulshan / Mt Baker in the distance, looking north/west from the summit of Ingalls Peak.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two double-length rappels had us back at the base in no time.  Somehow, we stayed too low in the scree field this time, and had to do even weirder shenanigans to get back over to the gully / slabs on the way back to the lake.  But oh was it worth it: a quick dip in the lake brought me back to life after roasting in the sun all day.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-12&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-12&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I much prefer the victory dip to the sport-climbers’ victory whip.&lt;/span&gt; A perfect cap to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back to camp just after 5pm, had a quick snap and were fast to break things down, and were on our way by 5:45.  A smooth and uneventul—minus encroaching foot soreness and hunger—walk back out brought us to the car in an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 1.5 fun indeed; just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>_Technopoly_ by Neil Postman</title>
    <link href="https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/technopoly/" />
    <updated>2025-08-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/technopoly/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780679745402&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Neil Postman (audio).
After reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/amusing-ourselves-to-death/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I was keen to read more Postman.  This book, from just under a decade later, picks up some of the same themes,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;For instance, making reference to his idea of the “Peek-a-Boo World” of rapid image-change, well before the likes of TikTok existed.&lt;/span&gt; describes a progression of cultures and their relationship to technology, from tool-using, to technocracies, to technopoly.  This latter—a coinage of Postman’s—was not explicitly defined, but broadly refers to a culture where the dominant values and forms of cultural life are seen as &lt;em&gt;subservient&lt;/em&gt; to technology.  By contrast, in a technocracy, tools are a central metaphor pervading all forms of thought and metaphor, but are still intended to help, promote, and augment that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat of the book contains many interesting historical episodes—for instance, the history of numerical grading and the invention of management structures as well as a science thereof were news to me—and articulation of many ways in which technologies have become invisible while shaping our lives.  But, for possibly idiosyncratic reasons, I want to focus on the final chapter, where Postman self-consciously moves from critic to advocate, articulating a theory of change largely centered on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter—“The Loving Resistance Fighter”—begins by articulating, against the backdrop of the first Persian Gulf War, reasons for Americans to feel proud of their country by reminding people of values and a vision for society articulated in the nation’s founding.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;This need, given the behavior of our governments, feels like one of the dominant themes of my teenage and adult life.&lt;/span&gt; It then moves to education as a mechanism for developing resistance to technocracy, by articulating a vision for education that is less instrumental than the dominant one (still to this day) of producing an efficient workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postman’s vision, perhaps surprisingly, centers two disciplines as foundational: history and semantics. History plays a central role because every discipline, scientific or humanistic, has a history.  My first reaction was that this was true of philosophy as much as history.  Of course, I quickly realized that I have many friends who are historians of philosophy&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I even dabbled in it myself, writing a qualifying paper in grad school on Kant.&lt;/span&gt; as well as a few who are philosophers of history.  So, it just might be that there’s a cycle at the foundation of this enterprise.  Postman advocates for a teaching of each discipline that makes frequent and explicit reference to its history, so that students can situate current knowledge and practice in the long march of humanity to its present state.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;He explicitly models this form of education on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_of_Man&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ascent of Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though he updates it to “the ascent of humanity”.&lt;/span&gt; Against this backdrop, history then should focus on comparative history, and the art and practice of crafting histories and understanding how each one expresses the “raw facts” in a particular way and through a particular lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a semanticist,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I actually am, but this is a joke for my friends.&lt;/span&gt; I was especially surprised to hear semantics mentioned next as a foundational discipline in Postman’s vision for education.  Perhaps I shouldn’t have been: this and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/amusing-ourselves-to-death/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both emphasize the symbolic landscape in which we are embedded, and which signs have which meanings.  Postman’s argument is that semantics—in his definition, which may be closer to philosophy of language or metasemantics as currently understoody, studying how language relates to the external world, how symbols acquire meaning, and the different types of signs—equips students to question their environment and the cacophany of symbols that they encounter in their daily lives.  He argues that creating such an inquisitive attitude is esential to resisting technopoly but that the lack of docility so inculcated makes it unappealing to many in the managerial class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is not without its flaws: lack of precise definitions, some cherry-picked examples, and a sweeping critique of social science as a whole which felt somewhat unfair.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Something I intended to write more about, but am out of time and space at the present.&lt;/span&gt;  But: it was thought-provoking and has given me several things that I plan to continue to think about.  That’s more than can be said for a lot of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: B+&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>_Uplifted_ by Sonnie Trotter</title>

    <updated>2025-07-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/uplifted/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781952338182&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uplifted: The Evolution of a Climbing Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Sonnie Trotter (audio). As you may notice from the selection of books reviewed here, I have a soft spot for the climbing memoir genre.  This latest entry comes from Sonnie Trotter, someone I’ve always admired for a combination of well-roundedness&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;He’s climbed at the highest level in sport climbing, single-pitch trad climbing, and alpine multipitch climbing.&lt;/span&gt; and what seems like genuine humility.  This book recounts his history in climbing through many short and digestible essays, many of which can be read (or listened to) independently.  Some stories were particularly engaging to me: a trip to Mexico with Alex Honnold, one visit to Patagonia, and the story of the first ascent of Pineapple Express on El Cap in Yosemite.  These stories were interesting enough that they overcame what I see as the primary limitation of this book: the prose has a simplicity to it that makes it hard to stay excited on a page-by-page basis.  And while there’s certainly no point in complexity for complexity’s sake&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Lord knows we don’t need more self-aggrandizing angsty-teenager prose in the world.&lt;/span&gt;, I found myself wanting more from the writing itself.  For example, the literal last sentence of the book (in an interesting Epilogue about the recent rockfall in the Bugaboos): “But what will always remain the best part for me is having fun with good friends in high places.”  To be fair: I suspect that this is one of those books that’s a hybrid between a memoir and a coffee-table book,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Patagonia in particular has been known to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/training-for-the-new-alpinism/&quot;&gt;books in that hybrid style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; so this may be a case where the medium (audio) really did hurt the message.  Grade: B-&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prusik Peak, West Ridge</title>
    <link href="https://shane.st/trip-reports/prusik/" />
    <updated>2025-07-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://shane.st/trip-reports/prusik/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-backdrop&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The backdrop &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://shane.st/trip-reports/prusik/#the-backdrop&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, after climbing some “alpine sport” routes and the west ridge of Forbidden Peak,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Post-hoc trip reports to come at some point.&lt;/span&gt; I’ve wanted to acquire more skills in traditional lead climbing in order to “open up the alpine” so to speak.  The iconic west ridge of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik_Peak&quot;&gt;Prusik Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the Enchantments had been at the top of my wish list for a long time.  But a grueling approach and a competitive lottery system for camping means that most ascents are extremely long car-to-car efforts.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I personally know &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; climbing partnerships that have been ruined by such an effort.&lt;/span&gt;  For now, I had mentally committed to only climbing Prusik if I was able to camp nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 17 this year, I groggily read an email titled “Enchantment Permit Area Advanced Lottery Lottery Results Announcement - Congratulations!” and found out that I had won a permit for four people to stay in the core zone of the Enchantments from July 4 - 7!&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;True beginner’s luck: this was my first time applying for the lottery.&lt;/span&gt;  Needless to say, the “race” was on: my mind instantly turned to Prusik and began taking stock of what needed to happen in the just-under-four months left to be comfortable climbing it.  What followed was a fairly frenzied collection of small clinics, more multi-pitch climbs, and my first few trad leads.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I might write that process up as a post of its own.&lt;/span&gt; Going into the trip, I was fairly confident that B, my friend Ian, and I could have a nice time on a beautiful alpine route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-approach&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The “approach” &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://shane.st/trip-reports/prusik/#the-approach&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s a downside to the camping strategy: climbing gear, rope, sleeping gear, and food for 3-4 days meant that my backpack weighed in at around 54 pounds.  Hiking up Asgard Pass (~2000 vertical feet in one mile) with that load was pretty, pretty, pretty tiring.  We had planned on doing Prusik on July 5, our first full day up there, but decided that we needed a day with no alarms to recover from the hike in.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Luckily, the weather was forecasted to be great for the entire trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound up having a quiet morning before taking a walk to tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.summitpost.org/little-annapurna/151427&quot;&gt;Little Annapurna&lt;/a&gt;, which has a very high juice-to-squeeze ratio: with a bit of low-angle walking&lt;label for=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-5&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;And a couple of small snow-fields at this time of year.&lt;/span&gt;, we were rewarded with views that exceeded expectations and were back in camp very early still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day “began” when B got out of the tent at 2am for a pee break.  I had brought a small and light tripod with me, hoping to do a little bit of night-time photography.  Although I didn’t carve out a dedicated time for this, the shots I was able to capture just from leaning out the tent for a couple of minutes in the middle of the night were pretty mesmerizing.

&lt;p&gt;Because of our somewhat-late arrival on our first night, we decided to set up base camp at an unnamed tarn one tier down from Isolation Lake (the first big lake when you get into the core zone above Asgard Pass).  This was a lovely spot: easy water access, not too many bugs, and just below a snowfield that goats loved to use both for transportation and play.  But it did mean that we had an approach of almost 2 miles with a little bit of elevation gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a relatively-short approach and also a “short” climb, we started walking at the luxurious hour of 9am,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-6&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-6&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I’m realizing now that it’s been awhile since I’ve had a real alpine start.  Getting old?  Or just wise?&lt;/span&gt; saying goodbye to the fourth person in our party, who was heading out of the zone entirely that day.  The first 3/4 of the approach was smooth sailing: some elevation loss, including a fun 100ft glisade section, and then a nice and easy romp up to Prusik Pass.  From there, we made the mistake of going up and over the first bump, instead of around it, which definitely slowed us down a bit.  After that extra bit of scrambling, we eventually refound the main approach path, scrambled up one more knob, and found ourselves at an overhanging rock at the base of the route.  &#39;Twas a perfect place to stash big bags and gear up for the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-climb&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The climb &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://shane.st/trip-reports/prusik/#the-climb&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route starts with a long first pitch, accentuated by a wide crack (5.6ish) in an unusually white section of rock (see below).  It was quite cruisy climbing through this section, which was a nice way to calm a few nerves that arose since this was some of my first alpine trad leading.  From here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105808527/west-ridge&quot;&gt;the beta we had&lt;/a&gt; said to continue “through blocky climbing to the West Ridge. Belay when the ridge levels out or when you hit a flat trail.”  The climbing was certainly blocky enough, but it was hard to tell what the flat trail was and/or when the ridge leveled out.  One section here was especially opaque to me; after going back and forth between a couple of options, I committed to just wrestling to the top of an awkward off-width with a flaring lip. Eventually, I saw a rappel station (a lot of tat around a block) at the top of a beautiful swooping flared crack and headed for that.  I secured myself, almost using the full 60m of our shorter rope&lt;label for=&quot;sn-7&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-7&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;B was on my 70m 8.6, and Ian on his 60m 8.0.&lt;/span&gt;, and belayed both B and Ian up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up at the start of the route, with the prominent white crack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch 2 began with a short burly roof pull after a stemming corner.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-8&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-8&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I remembered seeing photos of this little section in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francisbaileyh.com/2022/09/29/prusik-peak/&quot;&gt;one other trip report&lt;/a&gt;, so that made me feel better about the anchor choice as well.&lt;/span&gt;  Actually: it began with me pausing in the corner after placing my first piece while Ian and B tried to undo the mistakes of some horrible rope management on my part.  After that, a couple of traverses and downclimbs put me on what clearly was a trail.  I think the intention was to traverse left on a slab at the base of the flaring crack that leads to the tat anchor we used.  One more face section led back to the ridge proper, at which point I did the “air step” across from one boulder on to another.  A quick slab section led to two major horns that were easy to sling for an anchor.  Looking back at this pitch (see below), the ropes almost look like a zip line at the start of the pitch, with so much up-and-down wandering there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking down from the top of pitch two, with the air step visible at the base of the slab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch 3 begins with the crux slab.  After clipping one very old piton and placing a backup micro-cam, there’s about 20 feet of 5.7 slab climbing that ends in a glory jug.  Unfortunately, we didn’t take any pictures of this section, but they aren’t hard to find anywhere online.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-9&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-9&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;My one regret of the day was that we as a group did not take that many photos on the route itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After placing the back-up protection, I committed to the crux and flew up it fairly quickly.  Although it’s a bit mentally committing, there are great feet the whole way through, and the arete is also positive in lots of places, so it really was not too bad of a section.  After topping out the slab, the pitch turns into a long, wandery, traverse-y one.  One tip-toes around the famous large boulder on top of the ridge (see Ian and B below), after which there’s an even more exposed bloc that one either tip-toes around or passes with an au-cheval move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it’s mostly walking on a flat grassy section to get to a nice ledge system to set up an anchor.  After playing around to find three good pieces of pro for the anchor (a slung horn, one green cam, and a nut), I was happy to apply a technique I’d recently learned from the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.butterfieldguiding.com/&quot;&gt;Adam Butterfield&lt;/a&gt; in a clinic: girth hitching a biner to create the master point when your soft material isn’t long enough to tie into a knot itself.  It felt good to apply a technique recently learned in ground school “in the wild” so to speak.  One small note on pitch 3: with the long traverse-y section, there was some pretty bad, but probably unavoidable, rope drag.  The ony other option would be to break it up into two pitches; choose your own adventure there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that pitch 4 had two variations: a 5.6 off-width and a 5.8 finger-crack.  I opted for the latter since it looked like more “normal” climbing and I do not exactly have a lot of off-width technique dialed.  Thirty to fourty feet of very easy climbing led to a nice stance at the base of this finger crack, which has a ramp shape (ending vertically) and an “open book” corner vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The 5.8 finger crack variation to the final pitch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to climb it in a mix of crack and compression styles, using the right arete and mostly smearing the face for feet (with the occasional little feature to help as well).  After placing two pieces, I was just getting ready to put in a third when the small feature my left foot was on broke and sent me flying.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-10&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-10&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Maybe it would have been wiser to stem the corner and use the crack more instead?  Who knows.&lt;/span&gt;  Luckily, the #0.2 I had placed 5-6 feet below held perfectly and it felt like a normal sport climbing fall.  Nevertheless: the final pitch of Prusik felt like a hell of a place for my first trad lead fall.  After a short moment hanging there, I pulled back on, climbed above that same piece, put in one more piece (a micro-cam), and then climbed very quickly for the top of the crack, which was a lip jug that was easy to pull up and over on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, there’s some fun climbing around a corner on to one more ledge.  There’s one random bolt when you pull the lip; I clipped into it, but even with a long extended alpine draw, I down-climbed and unclipped that bolt because of heinous rope drag.  At that point, the only thing between you and the summit are two chimneys.  I pulled out a print-out of Nikkin Fumki’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://drawntohighplaces.com/products/prusik-peak-west-ridge-topo&quot;&gt;beautiful painted topo of the route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;sn-11&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-11&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I also ordered prints for myself, Ian, and B after we got home.&lt;/span&gt; and was happy to see that it said to take the left chimney.  It also says to go “through the hole to be birthed to the summit”.  As cool as that sounded, it looked really claustrophobic.  After some wrestling (and annoyance with my small pack getting in the way), I was happy to find that the right side of the chimney had some huge jugs on the side/top, so was then able to pull up and over on to the summit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed might have been my actual crux: even though I was able to take my climbing shoes off at a comfortable belay station, the rope drag was heinous, the sun was baking, and I was being eaten alive by mosquitos.  My left forearm started cramping as I was pulling the ropes up, since it had had enough of that motion throughout the day.  All worth it though: Ian and B cruised up the pitch and joined me on top for a proud summit selife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two double-lengths and one single rappel got us back to terra firma fairly quickly.  Starting the first rap is a little awkward, squeezing into a little chute, but then is smooth sailing.  The rope did get stuck when we were pulling after the first one.  Luckily, my micro-traxion came to the rescue and we were able to use its progress capture to put enough pressure on the rope to get it unstuck.  This was actually the second time in as many weeks that this trick came in handy and saved us from having to ascend the rope to get it free.  I’m never climbing a multipitch without one now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mostly smooth sailing from then on out.  Easy return to our gear stash and to Prusik Pass (no problem finding the trail &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the first bump from this direction).  The sun was starting to set, which treated us to some glorious views on the hike out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a sucker for lake reflection shots, and Inspiration did not disappoint.  This was just before walking up the section we glisaded down, which also would put us mostly back at the elevation of our camp and mark the transition to the much-needed “final stretch” home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that short climb section, we turned around for our last looks at Prusik and the route we had just climbed.  It’s always such a satisfying feeling to look at a route and say “we were just there”.  Especially one like this that’s relatively hard to get to and that most people only see in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to camp just before 10pm, making a 13hr camp-to-camp day,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-12&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-12&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;We were definitely slow as a team of 3, especially with getting lost on the way in, but so it goes.&lt;/span&gt; and found an absolute treat: our fourth person’s partner had come up to meet them and left two Rainier beers and a flask of whisky for us at camp.  I’m no stranger to the post-exertion beer,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-13&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-13&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;The car beer after a ski tour is probably my favorite.&lt;/span&gt; but this one might be the single best sip I’ve ever had, especially when you combine the setting, the surprise factor, and everything else that went in to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the weather was perfect at that hour, after high winds the previous night sent us in to our tents at 8pm.  We enjoyed our refreshments and  nice hot rehydrated meal as we watched the sun set and the stars rise.  Definitely a day to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

This book chronicles the history of the commercial guiding industry on Everest, departing from standard books about Everest in taking a wide view on the history of this peak instead of recounting particular experiences.  It also departs from standard tales of Everest by not force-feeding the reader with a particular viewpoint on issues like overcrowding and the like.  The tale begins with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bass&quot;&gt;Dick Bass&lt;/a&gt;’ ascent as part of his endeavor to be the first person to climb the “seven summits” (highest point on each continent).&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I first heard of Bass thanks to a statue at Snowbird, which he owned and operated for many years as well.  Although the plaquard conveyed some of his colorful story, I didn’t know the extent of his fame or the influence of the resulting book that he wrote.&lt;/span&gt; Bass might be singlehandedly responsible for the “rich tourist” stereotype of guided clients on Everest.  Although Bass paid mountain guides to go on his trips, he was a member of a climbing team and not officially a client of a guiding service.  The book then recounts the race to become the first commercial operation to take a client to the summit of Everest&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;In 1991! I didn’t realize how recent it was.&lt;/span&gt; as well as many ensuing developments, including the two most tragic years&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;One being the day recounted in Krakauer’s &lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; and the development of Nepali-owned and operated guiding services.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;The book dedicates a whole chapter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmal_Purja&quot;&gt;Nimsdai&lt;/a&gt;, which is apprropriate given his fame.  Although it does a good job explaining the love/hate dynamic around a polarizingly self-aggrandizing figure, the chapter does not at all mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/sports/mountaineering-sexual-harassment-abuse-nims-purja.html&quot;&gt;the extremely detailed New York Times piece&lt;/a&gt; accusing him of sexual harassment and abuse.  I suspect this has to do with when the book went to press, but it feels like a glaring omission given the date the book was actually released.&lt;/span&gt;  The book is well-researched, fast-paced, and an engaging read (errr, listen).  This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/thirty-below/&quot;&gt;the second time in recent memory&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve been turned on to a book from the podcast tour and, once again, the book was so much richer than the abstracted-away talking points were. I’d recommend the book to anyone interested in the history of mountaineering and the commercialization of both Everest and of nature in general.  Grade: A-&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781419771538&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thirty Below: The Harrowing and Heroic Story of the First All-Women’s Ascent of Denali&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Cassidy Randall (audio).  In some ways, the subtitle tells it all: this book recounts teh first all-women’s ascent of Denali, which was also the first such ascent of any of the highest peaks in the world.  As Randall puts it early in the book: we had put a man on the moon before a woman on a high peak.  I first heard about this book during a tour through the climbing podcast world&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/76AIVjndCoESTvfjNbCWX8?si=x1NmsDycRim_PUOjN1KpMA&quot;&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the American Alpine Club’s podcast.&lt;/span&gt; and was excited to see that my local library already had it available as an audiobook.  The book goes into great detail about the obstacles facing women in climbing and mountaineering at the time—shocking to hear in the concrete even if known in the abstract—and tells a riveting story of the climb itself, pieced together from everyone’s journals and the few written accounts&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Some memoir chapters, an American Alpine Journal article, and some local newspaper articles, but no national media coverage.&lt;/span&gt; previously available.  Anyone who loves reading alpine memoirs will enjoy the book for that dimension.  But what really sets this book apart is how well Randall builds the characters involved.  We learn about the leader Grace’s two failed attempts to climb Denali which, on top of the sexism she experienced, created a drive and stubbornness to get to the top that bordered on (probabl crossed over) reckless or dangerous.  Other characters are equally or more complex, and the resulting dynamics—taking place in the thin air above 18,000 feet—add richness to the story that makes it hard to put down.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;One meta-comment: podcasts are great, but this book is a great example of the limits of that medium.  The clif-notes version that I heard on a podcast was interesting enough, but contained almost none of the rich texture and character development that made this book what it is.  It’s good to have a concrete reminder in the value of long-form writing and paying attention thereto.&lt;/span&gt;  Grade: A&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>_The Sirens&#39; Call_ by Chris Hayes</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780593653111&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sirens’ Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Hayes (audio).  This book begins with the famed fable of Ulysses and the Sirens, as well as brief history and etymology of the word “siren”.  The reason: where sirens are designed to steal our attention from us and place it elsewhere where it is urgently needed, Hayes argues that the barage of notifications and other intrusions from smartphones and the like play the same attention-stealing function but without the societal benefit.  Rather: attention has been commodified and is being systematically extracted from us.  Like some commodities (oil), there is a fixed and finite amount of attention to be extracted; unlike oil, however, attention is “internal”, constituting our very selves.  Hayes argues that commodifying attention has produced wide-scale alienation&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I admire him for not being afraid to invoke Marx explicitly here.&lt;/span&gt;  I was also happy to see the non-trivial reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/amusing-ourselves-to-death/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the course of this argument.  Part memoir—Hayes admits to working in the attention business as a TV anchor and thriving off of recruiting and keeping hold on attention—, part history book, and part self-help book, &lt;em&gt;The Sirens’ Call&lt;/em&gt; ends with a call-to-action stemming from an observation that folks are beginning to pry back control of their own attention.  He cites the rise in “dumb phones” as well as the increase in vinyl record sales and interest in print media.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Though he focuses on newspapers, I see this in my world with things like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.summitjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Summit Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mountaingazette.com/&quot;&gt;Mountain Gazette&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://climbingzine.com/&quot;&gt;Climbing Zine&lt;/a&gt;.  These publications feed a need for long-form story-telling and artistic expression that the Instagram story can’t capture.&lt;/span&gt;  Let’s hope these movements—and perhaps a healthy does of regulation—wrest control back from the tech giants and help restore attention to its rightful bearers.  Grade: B+&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>_The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue_ by Mike Tidwell</title>
    <link href="https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/lost-trees-willow-ave/" />
    <updated>2025-04-24T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781250362261&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue&lt;/em&gt;, Mike Tidwell&lt;/a&gt; (audio). This book tells the story of the impact of climate change and what might be done about it through a very interesting literary lens: it tells the story of a group of large oak trees on the author’s street over teh course of one year.&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Whence the subtitle: &amp;quot;A Story of Climate and Hope on One American Street.&lt;/span&gt;  In contrast to large-scale statistics about the overall climate around the globe, this hyper-local story-telling helps make vivid that the impacts of global warming are already literally on our doorstep.  The book has several main characters. First, there are the large oak trees, which are victimized by a crippling heat dome in 2023 and resulting bettle infestations (not to mention dramatic flash flooding events), the loss of which both not only saddens locals but also greatly changes local ecosytems.  Secondly, there’s Ning Zheng, Tidwell’s neighbor and scientist, who is pioneering the idea of burying dying trees as a method of carbon capture.  Ning also serves as skeptical backdrop to one of Tidwell’s main personal aims in the book: to assess the feasibility (and possible necessity) of solar geoengineering, i.e. using things like aerosols to reflect some sunlight away from the earth’s surface as a method of cooling.  Thirdly, there’s Jamie Raskin, Tidwell’s representative in the US House, with a riveting story both in politics and his personal life.  These are primary characters, against a backdrop of many other personal stories told throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story-telling is neatly divided into chapters based on month.  So we get the story of one street through one year, with many other characters coming and going.  Tidwell’s a great writer, who can be forgiven for the occasional literary flourish.&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;For example, at the end of one chapter, with a very grandiose ending, I fully expected to hear “This concludes the presentation…”.  But perhaps this also has to do with the audio medium.&lt;/span&gt;  The book tries to provide hope—not least because Tidwell himself is looking for hope—but does not shy away from the realism of what is happening all around us.  Zheng, for instance, does not provide the simple assurance that Tidwell hopes he might.  Another source of hope: perhaps humanizing the problem in the way this book does will make more people willing to advocate for what must happen to save our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>_Beyond the Mountain_ by Steve House</title>
    <link href="https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/beyond-the-mountain/" />
    <updated>2025-04-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/beyond-the-mountain/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780980122770&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond the Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, Steve House&lt;/a&gt;. I picked this book up used for $4 at the public library in Bozeman, Montana awhile back and finally got around to reading it recently.  House is someone who I know a decent amount about, but mainly from reputation and from training resources&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;For instance, I’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://shane.st/blog/book-reviews/training-for-the-new-alpinism/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Training for the New Alpinism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; since his days at the bleeding edge of alpine climbing predate my interest in climbing.  This memoir recounts his career from 1990 through 2005, beginning as a rather green member of a Slovenian expedition to Nanga Parbat and culminating in his alpine-style ascent with Vince Anderson of the Rupal face of the same mountain.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-0&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;For which they won the 2006 Piolet D’Or, becoming the first North Americans to do so.&lt;/span&gt;  Along the way, we meet a person singularly dedicated to climbing as much as possible, often at the expense of other aspects of life like romantic relationships.  A long-term relationship, for instance, ends roughly because he doesn’t feel the depth of connection with his partner that he did with his climbing partners on a speedy ascent of the Slovak Direct route on Denali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ends with depictions of House’s reluctance to be in the spotlight after his climbs: an unexpected welcome ceremony in a local village after the Nanga Parbat, the Piolet D’Or awards ceremony, and a talk at the Ouray ice festival.  When reading the book, one often feels the same hesitance.  The prose is extremely direct.  While this has some refreshing qualities—House only occasionally enters into tired cliches about the mountains—it leaves the reader wanting more sometimes.  The book does have its literary moments. The description of the Rupal face climb jumps back and forth between the climb and the descent, creating a dizziness in the reader at first that must be a (very dim of course) reflection of their mental state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like House, the book thrives in the climbing sections, with very detailed accounts of what it really takes to get up and down some truly awe-inspiring lines in the big mountains.  Just like House, the book leaves the reader wanting more emotional depth, feeling like there’s more behind the surface that we don’t get to see.  In that sense, this memoir might indeed be a true reflection of its author.&lt;/p&gt;
