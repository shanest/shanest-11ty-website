<p><em>On Writing</em>, Stephen King.  This is (ironically?) the first thing I've read by Stephen King.<label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">test a sidenote.  If it gets too long, then what happens?</span>  I've owned it for many years, buying it during one of those pangs of doubt near the end of grad school; maybe this would be the book that turned the pangs into a new self-conception.  Needless to say, I'm not sure what prompted me to finally pick up after so long; even after I got tenure.  Oh: probably the book I'm over 18 months late on and the grant application I had to delay as well.  Anyways: great read.  I see why Stephen King has had the success that he has.  The book opened with a memoir section; a rather turbulent and fragmented childhood was mirrored both in the prose (short, punchy sentences) and in the structure (very short numbered sections) in a very satisfying way.  I won't go too much into the details of either his life or his suggestions (I think the four hours a day, every day, line has been repeated enough; and a small few things were a bit too specific to fiction writing), but will mention one other thing that stood out to me: his approach to writing as a craft (of course it is!), and the analogies to other crafts like plumbing.  I remember during grad school reading the introduction to Michael Dummett's <em>A Logical Basis of Metaphysics</em>, as erudite and obscure a book as exists (look at that title!), and being struck by the line, &quot;Philosophy, after all, is a craft, as plumbing is&quot;.  Several similar moments met me in King's book.<span class="marginnote">How about a margin note? And what if I make it really really long?</span>  Great read.  Not the last of his for me.  Grade:  A-</p>
