<p><em>Cultish: The Language of Fanaticism</em>, Amanda Montell (audio).  I stumbled upon this book just through browsing the Libby app, but thoroughly enjoyed it.  The name comes not just from analyzing cult-like groups, but is intended to evoke English and Spanish, in highlighting how language is used to form and shape groupthink.  Terms that were new to me---but labeling phenomena which are very much noticeable---include &quot;thought-terminating clich√©&quot;  (aka &quot;semantic stopsign&quot;) and &quot;love-bombing&quot;.  Although it did include detailed analyses of several typical cults (e.g. Scientology, Jonestown, Heaven's Gate), I especially appreciated the discussion of group fitness trends like CrossFit, SoulCycle, and Bikram yoga.  When I first became serious about physical training (for ultimate, in college), CrossFit was nearing its peak influence; luckily, I was able to extract some useful information while smeleling something a bit fishy in its celebration of suffering and zealousness of its supporters. (I also did a non-trivial number of Bikram classes during grad school.)  The final section covered social media influencers, highlighting a few from the wellness space that were news to me. The book also has a nice pace, with a clear structure, which also lent itself very well to the audio format.  Grade: B+</p>
