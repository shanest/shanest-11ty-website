### Mentorship

Regular participant in Pop-Up Mentoring Program (PUMP) for LSA events (e.g. SALT, NASSLLI)

- Via the Diversity and Inclusion Committees at various *CL conferences, I have led:
  - early career mentoring session on work-life balance
  - early career mentoring session on finding research questions
  - birds-of-a-feather for interpretability and analysis
  - birds-of-a-feather for semantics and natural langauge understanding
- As the above have been replaced, I am now a standing mentor for the ACL Year-round Mentorship Program.

### Professional Societies

- Association for Computational Linguistics
- Special Interest Group in Typology
- Cognitive Science Society
