# Welcome to my corner of the web!

Hello!  My name's Shane.

Professionally, I'm an Associate Professor in the Linguistics department at the University of Washington, where I work in computational linguistics and cognitive science.

In my non-professional life, I'm passionate about the outdoors---especially rock climbing, (backcountry) skiing, and bicycling---as well as food, design, and urbanism.
