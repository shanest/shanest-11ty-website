After a lot of multipitch climbing this year in preparation for and culminating in a climb of the West Ridge of Prusik Peak,^[I plan to write about this trip and some of the prep ones soon.] B and I spent most of July on our bikes, riding STP (Seattle to Portland) in one day^[207 miles!] followed up by RAMROD (Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day).  With summer starting to feel like its beginning to wane, and with lots of travel coming up in September, but also with our bodies being pretty fried, we wanted to take another trip into the alpine.  The goal: at most type 1.5 fun, beautiful views, fun climbing, and hopefully a "cute lil overnighter" as well.  Enter: [Ingalls](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110928196/ingalls-peak)!

## Day 1: Seattle to camp
