After a lot of multipitch climbing this year in preparation for and culminating in a climb of the West Ridge of Prusik Peak,^[I plan to write about this trip and some of the prep ones soon.] B and I spent most of July on our bikes, riding STP (Seattle to Portland) in one day followed up by RAMROD (Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day).^[Do organized bike rides deserve trip reports?!]  With summer starting to feel like its beginning to wane, and with lots of travel coming up in September, but also with our bodies being pretty fried, we wanted to take another trip into the alpine.  The goal: at most type 1.5 fun, beautiful views, fun climbing, and hopefully a "cute lil overnighter" as well.  Enter: [Ingalls](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110928196/ingalls-peak)!

## Day 1: Seattle to camp

In the interest of having a more casual outing, we left Seattle around 2 or 2:30pm on Saturday.  With one pit stop at the Safeway in Cle Elum, we reached the Esmeralda trailhead just after 5pm and started walking around 5:30.  The start of the trail---including the turn on to Ingalls Way trail after about a quarter mile---was great: shady, smooth, with a very gradual rise to gain elevation.  A group of trail runners flying down made it clear to us how imminently runnable this trail is.  Before too long, we were starting to poke above the trees and got our first view of Tahoma (Rainier).

The trail gradually became more and more exposed and accordingly dusty.  A definite high-desert feel.  After passing a fork for John's Pass, the trail makes almost a straight exposed line for Ingall's pass.  Though the terrain becomes slightly rockier, the trail maintains the gradual rise throughout, so you can really make great time gaining the vert.

On the other side of the pass, you can chooose to stay high or dip low into a basin.^[Trail 1390.1 up high, 1390.2 down low.] We didn't have a ton of beta on campsites, except an expectation that there are more on the low loop, but should be some up high too.  Since the former requires losing and then re-gaining some vert, we stayed up high and began keeping our eyes open for good sites.  Although it didn't seem like it at first, after another quarter mile or so, you pass through a grove and come to an area with lots of very nice sites, near the one real stream for water and even a pit toilet.  We poked around for a site that optimized tranquility, views, and proximity to water, and settled on a beauty.  We finished setting up the tent just in time to watch the sun set over the majestic Mt Stuart.

Speaking of tranquility, the one downside was a group of youths playing music from a boombox a few sites over.^[Not to mention leaving a full-size kitchen trash bag hanging from a tree at their site.]  I'm sure I don't need to get on a soap box here about leaving that at home or at least playing music softly enough so that it doesn't interfere with other peoples' experiences.  Luckily, their music choice was surprisingly enjoyable---Fleetwood Mac, Frank Sinatra, Alanis Morissette, Pink Floyd---and they did shut things down not too long after sunset.

We both recently upgraded to [Nemo Tensor](https://amzn.to/45LfArl) pads, which are amazingly comfortable.  Unfortunately, my ultralight "2-person" tent cannot really fit two wide pads.  Some creative geometry got them sandwiched against each other and the walls of the tent, and we were able to happily pass out after some delicious grocery store sandwiches and a little old fashioned in a plastic bottle.^[My friends know a small cocktial is one of my trail treats.]

## Day 2: the climb and exit
