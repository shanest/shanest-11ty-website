After a lot of multipitch climbing this year in preparation for and culminating in a climb of the West Ridge of Prusik Peak,^[I plan to write about this trip and some of the prep ones soon.] B and I spent most of July on our bikes, riding STP (Seattle to Portland) in one day followed up by RAMROD (Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day).^[Do organized bike rides deserve trip reports?!]  With summer starting to feel like its beginning to wane, and with lots of travel coming up in September, but also with our bodies being pretty fried, we wanted to take another trip into the alpine.  The goal: at most type 1.5 fun, beautiful views, fun climbing, and hopefully a "cute lil overnighter" as well.  Enter: [Ingalls](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110928196/ingalls-peak)!

## Day 1: Seattle to camp

In the interest of having a more casual outing, we left Seattle around 2 or 2:30pm on Saturday.  With one pit stop at the Safeway in Cle Elum, we reached the Esmeralda trailhead just after 5pm and started walking around 5:30.  The start of the trail---including the turn on to Ingalls Way trail after about a quarter mile---was great: shady, smooth, with a very gradual rise to gain elevation.  A group of trail runners flying down made it clear to us how imminently runnable this trail is.  Before too long, we were starting to poke above the trees and got our first view of Tahoma (Rainier).

The trail gradually became more and more exposed and accordingly dusty.  A definite high-desert feel.  After passing a fork for John's Pass, the trail makes almost a straight exposed line for Ingall's pass.  Though the terrain becomes slightly rockier, the trail maintains the gradual rise throughout, so you can really make great time gaining the vert.
