## The backdrop

For the last few years, after climbing some "alpine sport" routes and the west ridge of Forbidden Peak,^[Post-hoc trip reports to come at some point.] I've wanted to acquire more skills in traditional lead climbing in order to "open up the alpine" so to speak.  The iconic west ridge of [Prusik Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik_Peak) in the Enchantments had been at the top of my wish list for a long time.  But a grueling approach and a competitive lottery system for camping means that most ascents are extremely long car-to-car efforts.^[I personally know _two_ climbing partnerships that have been ruined by such an effort.]  For now, I had mentally committed to only climbing Prusik if I was able to camp nearby.

On March 17 this year, I groggily read an email titled "Enchantment Permit Area Advanced Lottery Lottery Results Announcement - Congratulations!" and found out that I had won a permit for four people to stay in the core zone of the Enchantments from July 4 - 7!^[True beginner's luck: this was my first time applying for the lottery.]  Needless to say, the "race" was on: my mind instantly turned to Prusik and began taking stock of what needed to happen in the just-under-four months left to be comfortable climbing it.  What followed was a fairly frenzied collection of small clinics, more multi-pitch climbs, and my first few trad leads.^[I might write that process up as a post of its own.] Going into the trip, I was fairly confident that B, my friend Ian, and I could have a nice time on a beautiful alpine route.

## The "approach"

Of course, there's a downside to the camping strategy: climbing gear, rope, sleeping gear, and food for 3-4 days meant that my backpack weighed in at around 54 pounds.  Hiking up Asgard Pass (~2000 vertical feet in one mile) with that load was pretty, pretty, pretty tiring.  We had planned on doing Prusik on July 5, our first full day up there, but decided that we needed a day with no alarms to recover from the hike in.^[Luckily, the weather was forecasted to be great for the entire trip.]

We wound up having a quiet morning before taking a walk to tag [Little Annapurna](https://www.summitpost.org/little-annapurna/151427), which has a very high juice-to-squeeze ratio: with a bit of low-angle walking^[And a couple of small snow-fields at this time of year.], we were rewarded with views that exceeded expectations and were back in camp very early still.  

The day "began" when B got out of the tent at 2am for a pee break.  I had brought a small and light tripod with me, hoping to do a little bit of night-time photography.  Although I didn't carve out a dedicated time for this, the shots I was able to capture just from leaning out the tent for a couple of minutes in the middle of the night were pretty mesmerizing.  Hard to beat a shooting star and aurora borealis over a lake as a view from your "bedroom".
