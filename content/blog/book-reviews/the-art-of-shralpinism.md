_The Art of Sharlpinism_, Jeremey Jones (audio).  I listened to most of this on the way back from an "eat pray ski" trip to Big Sky.  A compendium of "lessons from the mountains", it's a mix of stories from his and others' lives in the mountains as well as something of a how-to guide in places.  Two things that I'll take away: (1) "love of sport" days skiing/riding, i.e. going out even when it's bad conditions and still learning things and working on your craft; (2) "the church of the seven day recreationalists": from Jim Zellers (?), three rules: (i) recreate outside every day of the week, (ii) keep your house and life in order, and (iii) don't let (ii) get in the way of (i).  I will say that this book was not ideal for audio format: it has lots of "inserts" and "cut-out" sections which had starts and stops which were occasionally hard to locate.  You also don't get to see the beautiful imagery in the book. Grade: B+.
