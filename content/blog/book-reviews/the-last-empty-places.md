_The Last Empty Places: A Past and Present Journey Through the Blank Spots on the American Map_ by Peter Stark (audio). A guy from Wisconsin wanders to the "blank"/"empty" places in the lower 48, following in the footsteps of folks like Muir and Thoreau. Not uninteresting, but a little self-indulgent in places. Enjoyed learning about French versus English views on wilderness while colonizing (and that "cajun" derives from "Acadia"). Some interesting views on the role of large-scale ranching preserving wildness (in SE Oregon) as well. Grade: B
