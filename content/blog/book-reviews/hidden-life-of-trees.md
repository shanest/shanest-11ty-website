[_The Hidden Life of Trees_, Peter Wohlleben](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781771642484) (audio).  A wonderful book that explains the ways in which trees communicate, live and die, and even interact socially.  (Amongst many other amazing behaviors, e.g. wound-tending.)  Written by a forest manager, and covering some of the relevant academic literature (e.g. around the role of mycelium networks in aiding communication in root systems), this book felt like a very refreshing "natural history" kind of book: it's largely a narration of what you will see if you look closer and understand trees---and forests, in particular, as the difference between re-planted groves of trees and the richness of natural forests is a recurring theme---on their own terms and, in particular, at their own time-scale.  I certainly won't look at trees the same way after this.  Grade: A
