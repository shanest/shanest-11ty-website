_A Psalm for the Wild-Built_ by Becky Chambers (audio). A "solarpunk novella", really enjoyed this one. The first fiction I've been able to do on audiobook; might be partially due to it basically being two characters and just a couple place names, so not too much to keep track. A robot-human encounter centuries after "The Awakening", when the robots became conscious and were released from the factories to live on their own in the wild. A human narrator who has an objectively fulfilling life but feels unfulfilled; ends with a long meditation on the notion of "purpose" in life and whether humans are at all special. Grade: A
