_Mathematics for Human Flourishing_ by Francis Su. Elucidating the potential joy and beauty of mathematics in a series of chapters centered on different human... values? virtues? concepts? (e.g. love, community, power). Each chapter includes a puzzle, and a letter from an inmate that the author has corresponded with for years and who is teaching himself math. Hits a lot of themes I really do believe in (that math is a very deep form of human expression), but some of the chapters are a bit "forced". Grade: B+
