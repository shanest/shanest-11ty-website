_On Writing_, Stephen King.  This is (ironically?) the first thing I've read by Stephen King.^[test a sidenote]  I've owned it for many years, buying it during one of those pangs of doubt near the end of grad school; maybe this would be the book that turned the pangs into a new self-conception.  Needless to say, I'm not sure what prompted me to finally pick up after so long; even after I got tenure.  Oh: probably the book I'm over 18 months late on and the grant application I had to delay as well.  Anyways: great read.  I see why Stephen King has had the success that he has.  The book opened with a memoir section; a rather turbulent and fragmented childhood was mirrored both in the prose (short, punchy sentences) and in the structure (very short numbered sections) in a very satisfying way.  I won't go too much into the details of either his life or his suggestions (I think the four hours a day, every day, line has been repeated enough; and a small few things were a bit too specific to fiction writing), but will mention one other thing that stood out to me: his approach to writing as a craft (of course it is!), and the analogies to other crafts like plumbing.  I remember during grad school reading the introduction to Michael Dummett's _A Logical Basis of Metaphysics_, as erudite and obscure a book as exists (look at that title!), and being struck by the line, "Philosophy, after all, is a craft, as plumbing is".  Several similar moments met me in King's book.+[How about a margin note?]  Great read.  Not the last of his for me.  Grade:  A-
