[_All the Gold Stars_](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780306830334) by Rainesford Stauffer (audio). Possibly because I am the choir being preached to, this crusade against the pernicious effects of pervasive ambition didn't move me too much. I did learn that "chosen family" comes from LGBT communities. There was also a distinction between two kinds of hobbies: those that are for mere fun/ time-filling and those that require skill, practice, improvement, etc. (There was a term here that I want to look up.). I should reflect on these because I've always had the latter as hobbies. Grade: B-
