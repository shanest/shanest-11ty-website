_The Good Enough Job_ by Simone Stolzoff (audio). Another preaching-to-the-choir self-help book, but enjoyable because this one centered around several individual stories: of those who started a union at Kickstarter, lived in their truck at Google, and the like. The book is a general plea for re- and de-prioritizing work in your life.
