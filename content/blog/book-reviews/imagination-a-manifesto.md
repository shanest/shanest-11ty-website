_Imagination: A Manifesto_, Ruha Benjamin (audio).  I must confess to owning but having never made it through Benjamin's _Race After Technology_, so I was very excited when this short book came out in audio format.  A wonderful expression of and testament to the power of imagination and of dreaming about other possibilities, including other futures.  The book provides many good examples, and focuses on ways in which societal structures implicitly (and explicitly!) choose what kinds of people are _allowed_ to imagine and to dream.  The last chapter and appendix have some concrete exercises ("making shit up university" for instance) that seem useful and that I can imagine using in class in the future.  Grade: A
