_A Brief History of Intelligence_, Max Bennett (audio).  A surprisingly pleasant and informative evolutionary history of our species and, in particular, our cogntivie capacities, centered around five breakthroughs: navigation, reinforcing, simulating, mentalizing, speaking.  For me, personally, the history of navigation and its role in evolution was by far the newest of these, and quite interesting to learn about.  While there were moments when I feared the author would stretch credulity for hype, the summaries of the work that I do know were always surprisingly accurate and appropriately hedged (minus the prediction in the end that the sixth breakthrough will be artificial super intelligence).  Would recommend to friends and colleagues.  Grade: A-
