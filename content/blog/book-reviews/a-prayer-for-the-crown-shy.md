_A Prayer for the Crown-Shy_ by Becky Chambers (audio; started e-book, but then audio became available after chapter 1). Continues the themes from _A Psalm for the Wild-Built_ as Dex (human) and Mosscap (robot) head back into human society. "What do you need?" The question Mosscap has been seeking to answer about humans gets flipped on its head by Dex's father. The inability to answer this question stimulates more reflections on purpose, and the felt need for such, with suggestions that such feelings are overwrought. Ends with the two protagonists frolicking in the water. Grade: A-
