[_The Power of Habit_](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780812981605) by Charles Duhigg (audio). A pop-science summary of the science of habit formation and change circa 2012---cue, behavior, reward cycle---marketed either at the general population or a slightly more niche business manager type. Not uninteresting, still, especially for a few interesting anecdotes: integrating "Hey Ya" the song into radio playlists, the history of Febreeze marketing, and things of that sort. Attributing the success of the civil rights movement to habit formation felt like a bit of a stretch for me. The take home in the final chapter, and source of the title: once you know the science of habits, you can change them, whence their power. Grade: B
