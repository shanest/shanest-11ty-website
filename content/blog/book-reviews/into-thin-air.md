[_Into Thin Air_](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780385494786) by Jon Krakauer (audio). A detailed, honest, and in-depth depiction of the deadliest winter on Mt Everest in history. Maybe some hubris on top, but also a lot of Mother Nature doing her thing. Does not make me want to go there; humans are not meant to be there. Very well-written. Grade: A-
