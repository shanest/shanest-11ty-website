[_A Fine Line_](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781680515909) by Graham Zimmerman (audio). I was pleasantly surprised to find this brand new alpine climbing memoir that I'd been hearing about through the Seattle Public Library shortly after its print release. Zimmerman tells stories of his many expeditions to the large mountains and corresponding growth as a climber and as a person. The title reflects the main theme of the book: how to balance a passion for and drive for excellence in the mountains with stability, family, work, and things of that sort. An enjoyable read (listen), with a very dramatic story for the summit of Linksar. It does a pretty good job of capturing the special emotional state that being in the mountains and striving for large goals with peers can provide. While grappling with how to align a livelihood with values, it never becomes preachy. Worth reading. Grade: B+
