[_Life as We Know It (Can Be)_, Bill Weir](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9781797213613) (audio). This book was an odd mix of (i) interesting anecdotes that are intended to inspire climate optimism and/or a call to action and (ii) personal memoir.  This second component was especially prominent in one of the two recurring leitmotifs throughout the book: writing letters to his young son about what his climate future might look like.  (The other recurring motif was Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Both felt a bit forced.). While I did learn some things (e.g. about alternative food sources), the book honestly felt too personal to me, especially in the last couple of chapters when it became something of an apology for being a bit absent from his family while traveling the world for his TV shows.
