Starting in 2020, I began keeping track of all of the books I read, a habit I adapted from my brother.  For the first couple of years, I just kept the list, without reviews.  Here's the list of books I read in 2023, in reverse chronological order:

- The City and The City, China Mieville
- The Devilâ€™s Star, Jo Nesbo
- Rock Jocks, Wall Rats, and Hang Dogs, John Long
- Norwegian Wood, Haruki Murikami
- Gone Bamboo, Anthony Bourdain
- The Ice Lands, Steinar Bragi
- Delivered from Distraction
