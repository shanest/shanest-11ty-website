Starting in 2020, I began keeping track of all of the books I read, a habit I adapted from my brother.  For the first couple of years, I just kept the list, without reviews.  Here's the list of books I read in 2023, in reverse chronological order:

- [_The City and The City_](https://bookshop.org/a/111171/9780345497529), China Mieville
