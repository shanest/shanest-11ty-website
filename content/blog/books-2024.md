Starting in 2020, I began keeping track of all of the books I read, a habit I adapted from my brother.  Starting in 2023, I jotted down a quick long-paragraph review (with a "grade") of each book as well.  Here's the list of books I read in 2024, in reverse chronological order:

{% set postsyear = 2024 %}
{% set postslist = collections["book-reviews"] %}
{% include "postslist.njk" %}
